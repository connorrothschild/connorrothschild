ðŸ‘‹ Hi, nice to meet you! I'm a senior at Rice University, where I study the quantitative social sciences and minor in data science. There, I spend my time on data science (R), visualization (D3), and civic tech. 

Here on my GitHub profile, you'll find a mix of personal projects, work experiences, and works in progress. Most of my projects are built using some combination of **R** for analysis, **D3** for visuals, **Vue** for frontend experience, and **Bulma** for styling.

If you'd like to ask any questions about my process, or would like to collaborate on a project, feel free to reach out via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CL_Rothschild), or email [me@connorrothschild.com](mailto:me@connorrothschild.com).
