👋🏼 Nice to meet you! Through a fellowship with [Coding It Forward](https://www.codingitforward.com/), I'm currently working as a data scientist for the US Special Operations Command, where I'm building a machine learning for predictive maintenance of military helicopters.  

📚 I'm also a senior at Rice University, where I study social policy analysis. There, I spend my time on data science (R), visualization (D3), and civic tech.

💻 My GitHub repo contains a mix of personal and work-related projects. Here, you'll find a portfolio of my projects done in [R](https://github.com/connorrothschild/R), those done in [D3.js](https://github.com/connorrothschild/D3.js), and a more comprehensive coverage in [my personal website](https://github.com/connorrothschild/connorrothschild.com). 

📩 If you'd like to ask any questions about my process, or would like to collaborate on a project, feel free to reach out via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CL_Rothschild), or email [me@connorrothschild.com](mailto:me@connorrothschild.com).
